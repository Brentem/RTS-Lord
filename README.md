# RTS-Lord

## Introduction
RTS-Lord is a game that will be developed for the [The One Year Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/the-one-year-game-jam).
We plan to create a Retrograde RTS, because there are [Retrograde](https://itch.io/jam/retrograde-jam-3) and [RTS](https://itch.io/jam/rts-jam-1998) jams that interested us.
We decided to go for The One Year Game Jam, because it gives us a lot of time to do both.
